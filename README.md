### Shabbat Shield

This is a very simple example of how a site could use Javascript and CSS to hide the main content from view during specified times during the week. It has no dependencies. 

To try this example, `git clone` the repository and then `open index.html` 

To try on your site, 
1. add the shabbat_shield.js to your javascript folder and load it from each html page where it should be active. `<script src="js/shabbat_shield.js"></script>` 
2. Add the shield.css to your main css file AND customize for your use
3. Add a div with id "shield" to each html page where you want a shield.
